<h4>What is your website about?</h4>

<p> My website is going to be about helping first generation students navigate the complicated
    college process. This will give struggling students in high school a resource that they
    can go to for tips, important information, and steps on how to tackle the college applications. Being
    a first generation student myself, I recieved a lot of help from teachers and friends. I want
    to help other students now.
</p>

<h4>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h4>

<p>The objective of my website is to help first generation students who are applying 
    for colleges without fully knowing what has to get done. This site is important because
it is meant to assist, inspire, and prepare students for the college application process and college itself. </p>

<h4>Who is your target audience set?</h4>

<p>My target audience is primarily for first generation high school students who are 
    looking into applying for college, but don't have the resources to help them through 
    the process.
</p>

<h4>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h4>

<p>The college application process has a bunch of different components that are all crucial for 
attending college. Some of the content will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial Aid</li>
<li>Common Application</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Scholarships</li>

</ul>
