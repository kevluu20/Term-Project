    <h2>The Commom Application</h2>

    <p><img src="./images/commonapp.JPG" alt="commonapp" title="commonapp" height="200" width="600"></p>

    <h5>What is the Common Application?</h5>

    <p>The Common Application is designed to simplify the college application process by serving as a platform to apply to most colleges with only one application. It was created to make the process more efficient and organized.
        <br><br> The Common Application is a "not-for-profit, member organization committed to the pursuit of access, equity, and integrity in the college admission process." It is a free tool for students all around the world. There may be no fees to
        use the Common Application, however, there are almost always application fees for certain schools. Those fees can be waived based on your financial situation and school. Currently, more than 800 colleges and universities from 20 countries are
        members of the Common Application. Each year, more than one million students, a third of those students are first generation college students.
    </p>

    <h5>How do I get started?</h5>

    <p> <span> Step 1:</span> Create a Common App account
        <br><br> The first step that students must complete is to create an account on the website. All that is required for the sign-up is general information. You can create an account early to familiarize yourself with the application, however, you
        don't have to apply to colleges if it is too early. The Common Application usually opens up on August 1st of every year so be aware of how much time you give yourself to complete the application and learn how to use it.
    </p>

    <p> <span> Step 2:</span> Choose the schools you want to apply to
        <br><br> The second step is to do your research on the colleges you are interested in and see what requirements they have. (See <a href="applying.htm">Colleges</a> page to learn more about what factors to look at for colleges) The Common Application
        allows you to filter schools to your choosing, allowing to see what schools fit your liking. Make sure all testing and other requiremnts are met for certain schools since those may vary.

    </p>

    <p> <span> Step 3:</span> Complete filling out your general information
        <br><br> The third step is to fill out all the general information about you and your family. You are required to provide high school grades, activities, recommendations from teachers, school transcripts, and much more. Take your time with this
        step since it may take some time. Information about your parents or gaurdians is also required during this step.
    </p>

    <p> <span> Step 4:</span> Finish your application
        <br><br> The fourth step is to finish your application and double check everything. These are the sections that are on the Common Application:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Profile</li>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Activities</li>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Courses & Grades</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>The Common Application Essay</h6>

    <p>The writing portion of the Common Application plays a large role in helping colleges decide if students are going to fit into the school. The Common Application provides applicants with 6-7 different essay prompts that students can choose from. The
        maximum word count for the essay is 650 words. Choosing which prompt does not matter as long as students are able to show their true identity and who they really are that can't be seen on a resume. This essay would be the best opportunity to show
        colleges what makes you unique. Keep in mind that colleges might also have supplement essays that are specific to the college, in addition to the Common Application essay.
