        and 36 being the highest. The ACT includes a Math, Reading, Writing, and Science section. The Science section is used to test students' analysis skills and critical thinking. There are practice problems and exams online that students can use to
        help prepare them for the real exam. Time management is very important for exams like the ACT and SAT. Make sure you have time to complete the entire exam and check over your work if possible.

    </p>

    <h4>Should you take the SAT or the ACT?</h4>

    <p>Both exams generally cover the same material and schools often don't have a preference when it comes to what exam to take. This ultimately comes down to what types of questions you prefer and and the format of the exam. Take the practice exams of
        both the SAT and ACT and recognize the differences. Both exams have a different pace, feel, and look so it is essential that you choose the exam that will maximize your performance and score.
