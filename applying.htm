    <p><img src="images/page header.jpg" alt="header" title="header" width="600px" height="300"></p>

    <p>Applying to colleges can be very tough. There are so many options for students to choose from in the United States and around the world. In addition, there are also many factors that can affect your decision when choosing what college is right for
        you. Take your time. Make sure that the decision you make is the best opportunity for you to grow and succeed.</p>

    <h5>Do Your Research</h5>


    <p>Some factors to consider when looking into colleges are the programs available, location, financial aid, extracirculars, tuition, statistics for graduation and employment, and many more. It is up to you what factors are most important to you.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some tips when picking the college that is right for you.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Read student reviews online</li>
        <li>Explore the college website</li>
        <li>Look social media accounts to see what it is like There</li>
        <li>See if the city/town fits the environment you want to live in</li>
        <li>Rank your top schools using your own system</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Campus Tours and Information Sessions</h5>

    <h6>Campus Tours</h6>

    <p>Campus tours may be difficult for students depending on where they live and where the school is located. However, if it is possible, signing up for a campus tour can be very beneficial and strongly sway your decision in the end. These tours give students
        a feel of the general environment of the school and what real-life students are like around campus. Here, students can see if they will be able to fit in or not. They will also get the opportunity to see residence halls, dining halls, and different
        facilities around campus.
    </p>

    <h6>Information Sessions</h6>

    <p>Like campus tours, information sessions are usually done on the schools' campus so it may be difficult depending on location. However, another alternative to information sessions is reading more about the school on its website. At information sessions,
        potential students are able to hear from a real-life admissions people and students who have been through the college process already. This is the chance to ask any questions you have about the school and experiences that current students had
        on campus.
